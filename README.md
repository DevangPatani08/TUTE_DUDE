#### UI/UX
- Dynamic Rendering: The list of added to-dos should be displayed below the input field and rendered dynamically without reloading the page.
- Attractive Design: Create a good-looking website 
- Submission Guidelines
- Deploy the React code on Netlify and Vercel.

## Assignment - 3

### Objective

Creating a React application for an online shoe store involves several components and functionalities that work together to provide a seamless shopping experience. This guide will help you build a basic version of such an application, focusing on state management with the useState hook.

### Requirements

Your task is to develop a React application for a shoe store. It allows customers to view available shoes and add them to their shopping cart using the useState hook provided by React. The application should consist of the following key components:

#### Displaying Shoes:
You can display a collection of shoes available for purchase on the left side. Each shoe should include relevant information such as name, price, and an image.

#### Shopping Cart:
I'd like for you to implement a shopping cart on the right where users can add selected shoes and view their choices. The cart should display the name, price, and quantity of each item.

#### Add to Cart: 
Enable users to add shoes to their shopping cart by clicking on an "Add to Cart" button associated with each shoe. Implement the logic to update the cart state accordingly using the useState hook.

#### Remove from Cart:
Allow users to remove items from their shopping cart. Implement functionality to decrease the quantity.

#### Cart Total:
Display the total cost of all items in the shopping cart.

## Assignment - 5

### Objective
Develop a React application for an online shoe store with the capability to manage state using Redux. Implement a payment feature that allows users to transition seamlessly from the shopping cart to a payment page. Users should be able to view their cart contents, return to shopping, and enter credit card details for payment processing.

### Problem Description:
Let's make the app using React-Redux, and Redux Toolkit. The application should consist of the following key components:

#### Redux Integration:
Integrate Redux into the React application to manage the state related to the shopping cart.

#### Payment Option: 
Implement a "Proceed to Payment" button within the shopping cart. Clicking this button should redirect users to the payment page.

#### Credit Card Payment:
Include a form on the payment page for users to enter credit card details. 

#### Payment Page: 
Create a payment page where users can view their shopping cart contents. Provide an option for users to return to their shopping cart if they wish to modify it before proceeding with payment.

#### Search Bar: 
Include search bar functionality that is missing from the video. Therefore, implement this feature based on your understanding. 

#### Redux Actions and Reducers:
Define Redux actions and reducers to handle state updates for adding items to the cart and removing items from the cart.
