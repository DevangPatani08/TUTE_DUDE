## Assignment - 3

### Objective

Creating a React application for an online shoe store involves several components and functionalities that work together to provide a seamless shopping experience. This guide will help you build a basic version of such an application, focusing on state management with the useState hook.

### Requirements

Your task is to develop a React application for a shoe store. It allows customers to view available shoes and add them to their shopping cart using the useState hook provided by React. The application should consist of the following key components:

#### Displaying Shoes:
You can display a collection of shoes available for purchase on the left side. Each shoe should include relevant information such as name, price, and an image.

#### Shopping Cart:
I'd like for you to implement a shopping cart on the right where users can add selected shoes and view their choices. The cart should display the name, price, and quantity of each item.

#### Add to Cart: 
Enable users to add shoes to their shopping cart by clicking on an "Add to Cart" button associated with each shoe. Implement the logic to update the cart state accordingly using the useState hook.

#### Remove from Cart:
Allow users to remove items from their shopping cart. Implement functionality to decrease the quantity.

#### Cart Total:
Display the total cost of all items in the shopping cart.
